# MalDetector


Trying out to make a Malicious URL Detector in jS 


You need to use your own VirusTotal API key. 

Interrogations : 

Is it interesting to use algorithms to classify if its malicious or no or do a simple Yes/No depending of results with a total list ?

Possibility to use Virustotal API and PHP
